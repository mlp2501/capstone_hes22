Those patients already on a bisphosphonate will need to continue to receive the bisphosphonate as previously scheduled. 2. Pts must not have had prior radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to registration. Patient cannot have had prior Strontium 89, Samarium 153, or other radioisotope. • If a pt requires palliative radiotherapy, two consecutive rises (baseline value must be obtained after completion of radiation treatment) in PSA measurement are necessary, each separated from the previous by a minimum of two weeks. 3. No concurrent use of estrogen, or estrogen-like agents (i.e. PC-SPES, Saw Palmetto, or other herbal products which may contain phytoestrogens), or any other hormonal therapy (including megastrol acetate, finasteride, ketoconazole, and systemic corticosteroids) is allowed at any time during the study. Prior use of these agents will need to be discontinued 4 weeks or more prior to enrollment. Disease progression needs to be confirmed as outlined in inclusion criteria #2. 4. Pts with type I insulin-dependent diabetes or poorly-controlled type II insulin-dependent diabetes or a fasting blood glucose of more than 10 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) will be excluded due to difficulty evaluating the tumor metabolic activity using FDG-PET. 5. Patients must not have active angina pectoris, or known heart disease of New York Heart Association Class III-IV. Patients must not have a history of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to registration. No history or evidence of ventricular dysrhythmias or other unstable arrythmia is allowed (rate controlled atrial fibrillation is allowed if the patient is asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint). 6. Patients must not have any known history of carcinomatous meningitis or brain metastases. 7. No serious concurrent medical illness or active infection should be present which would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the therapy outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety. 8. No major surgery within 21 days of starting treatment with Panzem NCD. 9. Pts must not receive any investigational agents other than Panzem NCD for the duration of their participation in this trial.

There are no absolute criteria for BP readings with respect to eligibility (as determined by treating physician). 5. ( # 9 cont'd) (ii) Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, defined as: Hgb A1c >8.5%; or symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes > 1 per week during the two months prior to eligibility evaluation; or more than 1 glucose excursion to >300 mg/dL in prior two months--unless clearly iatrogenic and the cause has been eliminated iii) Lung disease requiring supplemental oxygen iv) Known chronic liver disease causing either fibrosis or synthetic dysfunction v) Known HIV infection vi) Overt psychosis, mental disability or being otherwise incompetent to grant informed consent or a history of non-compliance with medical care. 6. Hydronephrosis (either bilateral or involving a solitary kidney) that has not been addressed by means of a nephrostomy or indwelling stent. EXCEPTION: Non-obstructive hydronephrosis in setting of prior urinary diversion is consistent with eligibility. 7. Patients require ongoing therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), i.v. vancomycin, aminoglycosides, or other potently nephrotoxic drugs, and must agree to abstain from NSAIDs from the time the consent is signed up until 30 days after the last dose of study drug is received, other than low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day or less). 8. Any other medical condition that in the opinion of the principal investigator would compromise the ability to deliver or evaluate study drug. 9. Unwillingness to maintain adequate contraception measures for the entire course of the study 10. Age < 18 years. "

If patient answers ""no"" to 5 drinks per day for men and 4 drinks per day for women the patient is eligible. AUDIT assessment does not need to be administered. If patient answers ""yes "" to 5 drinks per day for men and 4 drinks per day for women the AUDIT assessment must be administered. If AUDIT score is > 8 patient is not eligible. 4. Use of illegal drugs or use of prescription medications for non-medical reasons in the past month. 5. Current use of chewing, dipping and pipe tobacco, or cigars. 6.

History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to nicotine replacement therapy. 8. Active Peptic Ulcer Disease 9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing, psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 10. Due to unknown risks and potential harm to the unborn fetus, sexually active women of childbearing potential must use a reliable method of birth control while participating in this study. Reliable methods of birth control are: abstinence (not having sex), oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), DepoProvera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable, although less reliable, method involves the careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel and/or a cervical cap or sponge. We encourage you to discuss this issue further with your doctors if you have any questions. 11. If you are pregnant, should become pregnant or suspect you are pregnant prior to or while participating in this study, you should inform your study physician immediately. Nicotine replacement therapy has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects and is classified as a FDA Pregnancy category D drug. The U.S. Clinical Practice Guideline states that pregnant smokers should be encouraged to quit without medication based on insufficient evidence of effectiveness and hypothetical concerns with safety. Pregnant women enrolled in the study and randomized to the Quitline group intervention should participate in the Quitline intervention but not receive the nicotine replacement therapy. 12. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with nicotine replacement therapy, breastfeeding women are excluded from the study.

A change in chemotherapy agents due to intolerance after brief exposure may not count in this assessment, pending review with Medical Monitor. 2. Patient has received external-beam radiation or another systemic anticancer therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to study treatment. 3. Patient has received treatment with an investigational systemic anticancer agent within 14 days prior to study drug administration. 4. Patient has received prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) agent or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4], OX-40, CD137) or requires concomitant treatment with DPP4 inhibitors. 5. Patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of the study endpoints. If the patient has a past cancer history (active malignancy within 2 years prior to study entry) with substantial potential for recurrence, this must be discussed with the sponsor before study entry. Patients with the following concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinomas in situ (including transitional cell carcinoma, anal carcinoma, and melanoma in situ). 6. Patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or any New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within 6 months prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmias not controlled by medication). 7. QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula (QTcB) >480 msec at Screening. 8. Patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications during the study. 9. Patient has brain or leptomeningeal metastases that are symptomatic and progressive on imaging. Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases must have received appropriate treatment. Central nervous system imaging is not required prior to study entry unless there is a history of CNS involvement or clinical suspicion of CNS involvement. Imaging of patients with a prior history of CNS metastases should be compared to prior imaging to discern disease progression. 10. Patient has an active autoimmune disease or Grade ≥3 non-infectious pneumonitis that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) or treatment with drugs (e.g., neomercazol, carbimazole) that function to decrease the generation of thyroid hormone by a hyperfunctioning thyroid gland (e.g., in Graves' disease) is not considered a form of systemic treatment of an autoimmune disease. 11. Patient has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy at a prednisone equivalent dose of >10 mg daily for at least 1 week or other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). 12. Patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled infection, suspected or active SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 13. Patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus, active or chronic Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C. Screening is not required. 14. Patient has any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicity. 15. Any dysphagia, odynophagia, esophageal dysmotility or stricture, known GI malabsorption syndrome, or intractable diarrhea that may significantly alter the absorption of orally administered study drug. 16. Patients with history of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension within 3 months prior to enrollment. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mmHg with assumption of an upright posture. "
