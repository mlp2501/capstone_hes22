NCT04129931	Phase 2	Asthma	"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"	10-Feb-15	Asthma	"Depression-Anxiety (Hospital anxiety and depression Scale: HADS) These questionnaires are best used as screening tools. As such they typically have high sensitivity but relatively low specificity. Many of their symptoms overlap with the symptoms reported by participants with asthma who do not suffer from these conditions. Therefore, participants who meet the established cut offs for these questionnaires will need to be evaluated by the investigator to consider the clinical significance of the positive questionnaire based on history and physical and available testing. The investigator will need to judge the presence, severity and control of a specific condition and determine if it is sufficiently controlled to keep the participant in the PrecISE protocol. If the comorbid condition(s) is/are not adequately controlled, the investigator may refer the participant for further evaluation/treatment, prior to enrollment in PrecISE. Rescreening is permitted (after at least four weeks) to determine if the participant is able to move forward in PrecISE once the comorbid condition(s) is/are under adequate control. It is expected that some of the participants may also have other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. These should be evaluated clinically as part of the complete history and physical done at initial evaluation. Their inclusions should be based on the investigator clinical judgement in line with good clinical practice principles. "	5
